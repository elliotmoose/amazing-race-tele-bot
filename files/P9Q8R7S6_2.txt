  To whoever is reading this, it means you've followed the trails I've left as a safety net.
  I went to the police with the evidence, but they didn't buy it. I'm heading back to HQ to
  to speak to ███████. 
  
  If things goes south.. at least the truth will be revealed. I think someone's following me.
  If you've gotten this far then you must be close. Check the cams at the police CENTRE. The
  location code is written on the drain cap in the compound, visible from OUTSIDE the centre, 
  on the east side.

  Hurry. It's only a matter of time before they destroy the evidence.
